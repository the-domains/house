Earthen Flooring Benefits & Costs

Earthen flooring is nothing more than what it sounds like -- humble, natural earth compacted with straw or other fibers and stabilized with various natural oils to form eco-friendly high-quality flooring. These floors are easy to clean, comes in a variety of textures, colors, and materials. It can be installed over nearly any subflooring, it integrates well with radiant heat systems and it's one of the cheapest flooring methods either conventional or green.

Earthen floors are picking up in popularity during the ever booming "green building" movement. Most earthen floors are laid over the top of a subfloor of tamped gravel and topped with a mixture of clay, sand and fiber. These layers can be 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch thick or more. The thinner layers will dry faster but require a better subfloor for strength or more layers. Earthen floors can be laid over the top of previously installed wood floors as well. The finishing generally involves a drying oil among which Linseed Oil is the most common application followed by hemp oil. Linseed is used to seal the floor and protect it from wear and tear. A final coat of Hard Oil and Wax Impregnation are also used for shine and weather proofing.

Some of the highlighted benefits include:

Inexpensive materials --- earthen floors can be done from scratch to finish for around a buck a square foot

Eliminates construction waste -- the excess materials can be recycled back into the landscape

Weathers well with over time if it is cared for properly

Attractive look and comfortable thanks to a slightly spongy surface, sometimes compared to the feel of leather

Minimal to zero pollution -- The processing is simple and the earthen materials require little or no transport.
